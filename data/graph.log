-------------------------- OBSERVATIONS --------------------------
- Truth genotypes: HRPC, column 2.
- Phased genotypes: HLA-mapper, column 3 (and column 5 in swapped).
- Unmatched tags (DIFF) in relation with the HLA-mapper phase are in the column 4 (and column 6 in swapped).
- Phasing Error: When the first allele of HRPC is equals to the second allele of the swapped HLA-mapped allele, and 2º hrpc == 1º hlam.
- Genotyping Error: When the phase is not inverted between HRPC and HLA-mapper, it is an error because is different by state.
                 - When the phase (HLA-mapper) is homozigous for one of the truth alleles or for a third extra allele.
                 - when the phase (HLA-mapper) is heterozygous and contains a different allele (by state) from the two truth alleles.
- Obs.: The allele 2 (2) represented by the asterisk in the ALT column of the HRPC vcf indicates a spanning deletion.
                 - It is when the physical position does not exist in this haplotype because it was removed by a larger structural deletion in this region.
